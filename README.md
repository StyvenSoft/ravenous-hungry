# BUILDING FRONT-END APPLICATIONS WITH REACT

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d000b8bb-67d7-44a3-b481-00ec6a83002c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/trusting-turing-ac21cc/deploys)

**Create Project & Components**

Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous Hungry”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

- Creating Static Components
- Passing Information to Components
- Setting the State of Ravenous Components
- Interacting with the Yelp API https://www.yelp.com/seeyousoon
- Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

- As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
- As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.

Finally, a few notes before getting started:

- In each project, you’ll be presented with the intended, final outcome (of that project) in the Codecademy browser component.
- You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It’s the base of the entire app, and it will likely take a few days to complete this project. It’s OK if it is not all finished in one day.
- If you don’t understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we’ll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.
- You should expect to complete all four Ravenous projects on your personal computer using your preferred tools (terminal, text editors, etc.).


## Let’s get started!

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

### `npm run build` [fails to minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)
